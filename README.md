TODO:

- [ ] package.json is not exported in `release\win-unpacked\resources` (and of course in the real build), need to figure out why and fix it.
- [ ] Implement error page, in case something fucked up with java installer (and a retry button).
- [ ] Implement relocator (when joal is started, load joal ui instead of embeded react).
